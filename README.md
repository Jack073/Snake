# Snake

Follow the instructions in `Server/README.md` to start the server, you should then be able to launch `GUI.py` in the GUI folder (`python3 GUI.py`), and the game will start after a short delay.

## Note
The server should be able to handle multiple connections at the same time, altough I haven't tested this so I don't know if this would affect performance (in theory any change wouldn't be noticable).
